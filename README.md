# Delta Force News

## Project Description
Delta Force News is a web application that leverages the News API to bring up-to-date news articles from various sources and topics to the user with some additional features. These additional features allow registered users to participate in the discussion in a couple of ways; such as 'liking' or 'disliking' a particular article, or by posting a comment under an article. Users can also view different curations of articles based upon various filter criteria, which can be saved and revisited more quickly later on by using the sidebar (where saved curation categories are shown as buttons).
